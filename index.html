	<p>Looking for a low level programmer with very little experience and too much testosterone? You have come to the right place. My name is Lucas Herzberg; I'm 15 and was born on March 8th 2001 to James Robert Herzberg and Cecilia Torne-Herzberg. Being that both my father and mother are engineers, I grew up with technological influence throughout everything. Ever since my first old box computer I've loved toying around with anything related.</p>
